        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Crepes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients, except vegetable oil, in a blender and blitz until smooth</li>
            <li>Pour the batter through a fine-meshed sieve into a large bowl</li>
            <li>Heat a medium-sized non-stick pan over medium-low heat, brush lightly with vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Pour a quarter cup of batter, while swirling, to coat the bottom of the pan</li>
            <li>Heat gently until the surface becomes matte, flip with a rubber spatula and cook for 10 seconds</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining batter and stack the finished crepes on a baking tray</li>
            <li>Allow crepes to come to room temperature</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Chocolate Cream</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place cream and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer, and beat for 3-4 mins until soft peaks</li>
            <li>Sift in the cocoa powder and continue to whisk until stiff peaks</li>
            <li>Place in the fridge until ready to use</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Chocolate Ganache</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the cream in a small saucepan or microwave until steaming</li>
            <li>Pour the cream over the chopped chocolate and cover with a plate/lid</li>
            <li>Allow the chocolate and cream to sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the chocolate has completely melted, then stir until smooth</li>
            <li>Set aside to cool as you assemble the cake</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Build the cake on a large plate or cake board (it can be difficult to move around if not)</li>
            <li>Lay one crepe on the board/plate and spread a thin layer of chocolate cream over the crepe, top with another layer of crepe</li>
            <li>Continue the process until all the crepes have been used</li>
            <li>Top the cake with the cooled chocolate ganache and spread by turning your turntable</li>
            <li>Place the cake in the fridge to set for a minimum of 1 hour before serving</li>
            <li>Dust with cocoa powder to serve!</li>
