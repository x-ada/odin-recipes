            <li>200 g diced strawberries</li>
            <li>2 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>50 g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>

            <li>140 g cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>60 g unsalted butter, room temperature</li>

            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Sweet Bun Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the warm milk, yeast and sugar, leave aside and allow to foam for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment add the flour, salt, milk mixture, egg, and egg yolk</li>
            <li>Mix on low until the dough comes together into a rough ball</li>
            <li>Turn up to medium and continue kneading for 1 minute</li>
            <li>Add the softened butter one tablespoon at a time, kneading in between each addition</li>
            <li>Once all the butter has been added continue kneading the dough on medium speed for 5- 10 minutes; the dough should be super smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into a ball and place in an oiled bowl</li>
            <li>Cover with cling wrap and proof in a warm place for 60 minutes, or until doubled in size</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Strawberry Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the strawberries, sugar and cinnamon in a small saucepan over medium heat</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring, until softened for 5-10 mins</li>
            <li>Add the cornstarch and mix constantly until thickened</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and cool completely as the dough proofs</li>
            <li>Transfer the proofed dough onto a bench top and roll it out into a large rectangle, about 5 mm thick</li>
            <li>Using a palette knife spread the cooled filling over the dough in a thin and even layer</li>
            <li>With the shorter side of the rectangle facing you, roll the dough into a tight log</li>
            <li>Cut the log into 12 even slices and place on 2 large oven trays lined with baking paper, leaving enough space in between each of them to expand</li>
            <li>Cover loosely with cling wrap and place in a warm place to proof for 30-60 minutes, or until almost doubled in size</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 170Â°C</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 mins, or until golden brown and cooked through</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and cool before spreading over the cream cheese frosting</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat until smooth</li>
            <li>Add the icing sugar and vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Mix on low until combined, then increase the speed and beat until light and fluffy</li>
            <li>Spread over the cinnamon rolls and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
